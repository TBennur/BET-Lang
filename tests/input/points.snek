; A program with a function that takes an x and a y coordinate and produces a 
; structure with those values, and a function that takes two points and returns 
; a new point with their x and y coordinates added together, along with several 
; tests that print example output from calling these functions.
; The output should be 4, 6, 8, 16, 18, 20
